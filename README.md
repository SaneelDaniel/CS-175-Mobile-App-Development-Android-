# CS-175-Mobile-App-Development-Android

A comprehensive repository showing my work done for the Mobile Development course with Android (Java and Android Studio), 
under Professor Ramin Moazeni, at San Jose State University

The projects are full-stack except for some without a database connection, but give a comprhesive look at Android Development with Java

The topics covered are:
  - Android
  - Sensors
  - UI development
  - XML
  - Maps
  - local/live data
  - System Functions
  - Content Providers/Receivers
  - MVC, etc.

Most projects have readme files and individual explanations under tha folders.
